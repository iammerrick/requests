# Requests

Requests for blog articles, podcasts or dare I say... conferences?

Hi my name is [Merrick](http://merrickchristensen.com)! I have been writing software for 10 years. That doesn't make me an expert by any measure but I certainly love programming. I specialize in web technology but have written native iOS applications & full stack applications alike. I am currently invested in Angular.js, React and authoring maintainable applications. I enjoy creating meaningful content but only if it truely connects with an audience and is something I care about.

I am a co-organizer of [ng-conf](http://www.ng-conf.org, the worlds original Angular conference. I am an infrequent panelist on the [JavaScript Jabber](http://javascriptjabber.com) podcast. I am a full time employee architecting [Domo](http://www.domo.com)'s mobile web application. I occasionally lecture at [DevMountain](http://devmountain.com) to help onboard beginners into the industry.
